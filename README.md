Create a function called fizzbuzz that accepts a parameter n. Have the function log all the numbers from 1 to n in order with the following exceptions:

If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, log "FizzBuzz" instead of the number
If the number is divisible by 3 but not by 5, log "Fizz" instead of the number
If the number is divisible by 5 but not by 3, log "Buzz" instead of the number
Write your code and run it with several examples to ensure it is working as expected. Use the modulus operator!

Example - fizzbuzz(15) would log the following (each element on its own line):

1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz
